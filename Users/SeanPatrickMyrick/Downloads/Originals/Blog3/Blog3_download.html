<H1>Plan:<wbr> rebuild my minecraft worlds</H1>
<H2>Made by Sean P.<wbr> Myrick</H2>
<p>Yes,<wbr> I know Minecraft isn't as popular as it once was<wbr>, but it was a huge part of my childhood up until the day that I lost all my progress.<wbr> I don't know what happened,<wbr> my account was unable to sign in<wbr>, and the launcher had errors.<wbr> Keep in mind,<wbr> at the time I was still using Minecraft 1.8,<wbr> waiting for 1.9 to come out,<wbr> a pretty long time ago.</p>
<p>When it crashed, I was in shock. I didn't think too much of it. Every time I tried to go near it again, I had issues. Lately, as of March 2019, I am really getting into it again, almost 3 full years later. I am determined to not give up now. I have the worlds still in memory (in my brain) and I am considering remaking all of the worlds.</p>
<p>There are a few requirements first:</p>
<p>На<b><i>Wait for Windows 8 to go out of support in 2025 (I thought it was already dead years ago until I looked it up today.)</i></b></p>
<p>На<b><i>Obtain a copy of Minecraft 1.8</i></b></p>
<p>На<b><i>Get better virtual machine knowledge and support (shared folders, prevent corruption from no usage (my machines randomly got corrupted one day and I don't know why) learn how to export to other machines)</i></b></p>
<p>I really hope I can do this. It might take me a very long time to do this, as I don't have as much free time anymore. It would be really nice to have everything back again! Thanks to RTGame for the videos that have peaked my interest in trying again.</p>
